abstract: Most of the training methods in network representation learning are of uniform level since they take the whole set of graph primitives as input. It is time consuming when dealing with the situation of real-world complex networks. Meanwhile, the scale-free property will be violated when networks consist of large amounts of high-degree motifs. We propose a computing framework that applies specific transformation towards the original graph and embeddings to deal with these problems. In this framework, a general architecture "anchor-spanner" is proposed as an efficient representation of real-world frequent motifs. The extensive experiments conducted in this paper illustrate promising results both on running time improvement with average of 20%-50% and up to 40% enhancement on network reconstruction tasks out of SOTA embedding methods. Our framework also holds excellent extendibility and adaptability towards various real-world environment and training methods.
