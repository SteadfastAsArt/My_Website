RentingX is aimed at the house renting market in China, which is a rising area because more and more young people tend to make a living in big cities where the price of apartment is too high for them to afford it, whereas Chinese traditional belief goes that owning a house is of vital importance.
So this platform is designed to fit their needs in various aspects including:
- attribute query, spatial query
- rank model in multi-dimensions
- interactive accessibility exploration
The data come from up to ten renting companies in China, most of them fail to utilize their resources.

Special thanks to my supervisor [Prof. Zhang Feng](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/fengzhang) for her dedicated efforts and recognition!
